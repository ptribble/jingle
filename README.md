Jingle provides a small number of utility classes for simplifying
development of Java GUI applications using Swing.

Most of the files here are licensed under CDDL, version 1.0, see the file
LICENSES/CDDL-1.0.txt, with the exception of SpringUtilities which is derived
from the Java Swing tutorial.

Requires jumble.
